SuperDSM
==========

SuperDSM is a globally optimal segmentation method based on superadditivity and deformable shape models for cell nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images and beyond.

The documentation is available here: https://superdsm.readthedocs.io

Use ``python -m unittest`` in the root directory to run the test suite.
